# Defense-system---Arduino
This Arduino-based defense system detects objects in real time using ultrasonic sensors, displaying them on a radar screen with Processing software. It calculates angles for targeting using trigonometry. The system uses LEDs to indicate threat levels and simulates shooting with a laser pointer based on object proximity.
