Arduino Defense System
This project is an advanced defense system built using Arduino technology for real-time object detection, threat assessment, and automated response. It features radar-style object tracking, laser targeting, and LED-based threat indicators. The system utilizes mathematical calculations, including trigonometric equations, to determine precise shooting angles based on object distance.

Key Features:

Real-time object detection and tracking with ultrasonic sensors
Mathematical calculations (Sin Rule) for angle determination
Automated response using LEDs and laser pointer for visual and simulated targeting
Radar display visualization using Processing software
LED indicators to display different threat levels based on object proximity
Technologies Used:

Arduino Uno Microcontroller
Ultrasonic Sensors, Servo Motors, and Laser Pointer
Processing IDE for radar visualization
Embedded C/C++ for Arduino programming
Future Improvements:

Mobile app integration for remote control and monitoring
Audio alerts and enhanced threat detection range
